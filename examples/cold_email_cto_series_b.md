## Generated Outreach Message

Subject: Congrats on the $50M Series B, Michael! Quick question about scaling security

Hi Michael,

Huge congratulations on Enterprise Solutions' $50M Series B! Scaling from where you are now to IPO-ready infrastructure is an exciting journey - I remember the sleepless nights from my time at Google when we were hitting similar growth milestones.

I noticed you're expanding the engineering team past 200 (impressive growth from the 50 you had last year!). I'm curious - with the rapid scaling ahead, how are you planning to handle the exponential increase in security surface area? 

The reason I ask: We've helped 5 unicorns (including Datadog and Snowflake during their hypergrowth phases) reduce security incidents by 70% while actually speeding up deployment cycles. Our platform essentially acts as an automated security engineer that scales with your team.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call next week to share what we learned from those implementations? Even if SecureScale isn't a fit, I'd be happy to share the security scaling playbook we developed.

Either way, exciting times ahead for Enterprise Solutions. The infrastructure challenges at your scale are the fun ones!

Best,
Emma Williams
Founder, SecureScale

P.S. - Saw your talk at DevOps Summit about microservices at scale. Your point about service mesh complexity really resonated - we should compare notes!
