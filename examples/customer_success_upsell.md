Subject: Congrats on the growth, Patricia! Quick question about your ProjectHub setup

Hi Patricia,

Hope you're having a great week! I noticed FinanceFlow just crossed 85 team members on ProjectHub - incredible growth from the 50 you had just last quarter. Congratulations!

I was reviewing your account (part of my quarterly business reviews) and noticed something interesting: your team is using some creative workarounds to handle enterprise-level workflows. For example, I saw you've set up 15 different workspaces to manage access controls, and your team has built 30+ custom automations to handle approval workflows.

Your innovation is impressive! But I wanted to reach out because these are exactly the challenges our Enterprise plan was designed to solve. With your current growth trajectory, you might find these features helpful:

✓ **Advanced permissions**: Role-based access at the project level (no more workspace juggling)
✓ **Native approval workflows**: Built-in multi-stage approvals (replacing those custom automations)
✓ **Priority support**: Dedicated slack channel with 15-minute response time
✓ **SSO integration**: IT mentioned you're rolling out Okta company-wide
✓ **Unlimited guests**: I noticed you're at 95% of your guest limit

The timing might be particularly good because:
- Enterprise plan includes onboarding for new team members (you've added 35 recently)
- Q4 budget planning is coming up
- You'd lock in this year's pricing before our January increase

Based on your usage patterns, Enterprise would actually cost just $8 more per user/month but would probably save your team 5-10 hours/week based on similar customers.

Would you be interested in a 15-minute call to discuss whether this makes sense for FinanceFlow? I can show you exactly how the features would work with your current setup - no sales pressure, just want to make sure you're getting maximum value.

Thanks for being such an awesome customer, Patricia. Your team's 94% daily active rate is one of our highest!

Best,
Tom Wilson
Customer Success Manager, ProjectHub

P.S. - Sarah from your team mentioned in our user forum that you're evaluating tools for Q1 planning. The Enterprise plan includes our advanced roadmapping features that might be perfect for that.
