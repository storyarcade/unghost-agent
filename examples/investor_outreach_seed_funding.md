## Generated Outreach Message

Subject: Your "Future of AI Agents" thesis + AgentFlow traction update

Hi Lisa,

Your recent post about autonomous AI agents replacing traditional SaaS workflows perfectly captures what we're building at AgentFlow. The example you gave about Salesforce's evolution particularly resonated - I saw similar patterns during my time building automation tools at Microsoft.

Quick context: After my exit to Microsoft in 2019, I've been heads-down building AgentFlow with my co-founder (ex-Stripe ML lead). We're creating what Zapier would look like if built today with LLMs at the core.

Early traction has exceeded our expectations:
- $500K ARR in 6 months (without any sales team)
- 15 enterprise customers including two Fortune 500s
- 142% net revenue retention
- Just closed our first $100K+ ACV deal

DataSync's CFO (I believe you led their Series A?) introduced us to their workflow automation team, and they've become one of our strongest advocates.

We're raising a $3M seed round to expand our engineering team and build out our agent marketplace. Given your thesis on AI agents and enterprise SaaS experience, I'd love to get your perspective on our approach.

Would you have 30 minutes in the next two weeks for a brief call? Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
Alex Rivera
Founder & CEO, AgentFlow

P.S. - If helpful, I can share our investor deck and a quick Loom demo ahead of time. Our lead engineer also built some of the core ML infrastructure at Salesforce that you might find interesting.

## Key Elements for Investor Outreach

1. **Lead with alignment** to their investment thesis
2. **Present traction concisely** with specific metrics
3. **Establish credibility** through background and team
4. **Create urgency** without being pushy
5. **Make it easy to say yes** with clear next steps

## Metrics That Matter to Investors

- Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue (MRR/ARR)
- Growth rate (MoM or YoY)
- Customer count and quality (enterprise vs SMB)
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and payback period
- Burn rate and runway

## Common Mistakes in Investor Outreach

- Being too vague about traction
- Not showing product-market fit signals
- Failing to establish credibility quickly
- Making the ask unclear or too large
- Not demonstrating knowledge of their portfolio/thesis
