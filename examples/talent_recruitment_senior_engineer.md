## Generated Outreach Message

Subject: Your "Scaling ML Pipelines" talk + what we're building at NeuralFlow

Hi Kevin,

Your recent talk on scaling ML pipelines at SystemsConf was brilliant - especially your approach to handling model versioning at scale. That challenge has been keeping me up at night as we build NeuralFlow's next-gen infrastructure.

I've been following your open source work on distributed-ml-toolkit (we actually use it in production!). Your recent PR on async gradient updates saved us weeks of development time. Thank you for that contribution to the community.

I'm reaching out because we're looking for a Principal Engineer to lead our ML infrastructure team, and your background is exactly what we need. Quick context on NeuralFlow:

- Building the "Snowflake for ML" - unified platform for training, serving, and monitoring
- $40M Series B from Andreessen Horowitz (closed last month)
- 30-person engineering team, growing to 100 by year end
- Already powering ML for 3 unicorns, including Canva

What makes this role unique:
- You'd own architecture decisions for a platform processing 1B+ predictions/day
- Direct collaboration with our research team (2 NeurIPS papers this year)
- Budget to build a 10-person team around your vision
- Competitive package: $400-500K base + 0.5% equity

I know you're probably happy at Meta and get dozens of these messages. But given your passion for distributed ML systems and open source, I genuinely think you'd find our challenges exciting. 

Would you be open to a casual coffee chat (virtual or in-person in Palo Alto) to discuss what we're building? Even if you're not looking, I'd value your perspective on our technical roadmap.

Best regards,
Rachel Thompson
VP of Engineering, NeuralFlow

P.S. - Our CTO, Jason Liu, was at Meta from 2015-2020 (worked on PyTorch). He mentioned you two collaborated on the distributed training framework - small world!
