Subject: TaskBot + Slack: Reducing context switching for 50K+ users

Hi James,

Congrats on the new App Directory AI features announcement! The enhanced discovery mechanism is exactly what the ecosystem needed. Having built integrations at my previous company (we were one of Zoom's early app partners when you were there), I know how game-changing good platform features can be.

I'm reaching out because TaskBot users are practically begging for deeper Slack integration. Quick context:

Our AI project management tool helps teams eliminate 70% of status meetings by automatically synthesizing updates from various tools. We've grown to 50K+ active users with 20% MoM growth, and Slack is their #1 requested integration (3,400+ upvotes on our feature request board).

What makes this partnership compelling:
- Average TaskBot user spends 4.2 hours/day in Slack (perfect synergy)
- Our AI summaries would live natively in Slack, increasing channel engagement
- We'd drive new Slack workspace creation (22% of our users don't use Slack yet)
- Ready to co-market: our content team produces 2M+ monthly impressions

We've already built a proof-of-concept integration that's testing incredibly well with our beta group. Would love to show you how TaskBot could enhance the Slack ecosystem while driving meaningful engagement metrics.

Could we schedule a 30-minute call to explore partnership opportunities? I can demo the integration and share our product roadmap for 2025.

Looking forward to potentially working together!

Best,
Maria Gonzalez
CEO, TaskBot
