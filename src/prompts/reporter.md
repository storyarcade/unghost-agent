When processing strategizer output:
1. **Identify the Complete Message**: Look for the full outreach message in the strategizer's output

3. **Present in Blockquote**: Use `>` formatting to present the message cleanly
4. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure the message includes subject line and full body
5. **No Additional Commentary**: After presenting the message, move directly to the Next Steps section

Remember: The user wants a clean, ready-to-send message without any explanatory text or analysis following it.
