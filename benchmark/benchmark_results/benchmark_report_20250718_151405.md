**Recommendation:** The message is excellent as is. However, to further improve it, I recommend adding a sentence or two that explicitly links the sender's interest in AI to human-centric design (e.g., 'I'm particularly interested in how AI can enhance user experience and align with human-centric design principles, which I saw you discussing recently.').
